# Inventory Management System (C)

A terminal-based inventory management system written in C, focused on real-world usefulness and low-level programming concepts.

This project is designed as a learning platform to go beyond basic CRUD operations and explore how an actual inventory system could be implemented at a low level.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Build a **practical and usable** inventory system
- Deepen understanding of **file manipulation in C**
- Apply **dynamic memory allocation** in a real system
- Improve **program flow, conditionals, and logic**
- Practice structuring a modular C project
- Experiment with **multithreading** where applicable

## ⚙️ Features

- Create and manage inventories using files
- Add, remove, and edit items dynamically
- Sort items (e.g. alphabetical order, quantity, price)
- Search items efficiently
- Handle stock entry and stock exit
- Persistent storage using files
- Basic user system (planned)
